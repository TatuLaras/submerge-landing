                        Language immersion aka. consuming content that's in a foreign language for
                        language learning purposes is <b>by far</b> the most effective language
                        learning method according to current research. It's the most natural, too.
                        Babies don't open a textbook to learn their native language, they listen to
                        their parents talking and they read their little children's books.

                        <b>Submersive Tracker is a tracker of your immersion:</b> the time you spend
                        immersing, what kind of immersion you do (reading, listening, active,
                        passive), and the content you choose to do it with. This app gives you an
                        intuitive interface to add that data to the current day or edit previous
                        days. Afterward, you can look at aggregate data graphs and statistics of
                        that data or get a more detailed view of it in a spreadsheet-like form. The app also includes some social features, letting you add friends and see their recent immersion data.
